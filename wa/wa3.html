            Jet Set Radio (originally released in North America as Jet Grind Radio) is a 2000 action game developed by
            Smilebit and published by Sega for the Dreamcast. The player controls a member of a youth gang, the GGs, as
            they use inline skates to traverse Tokyo, spraying graffiti, challenging rival gangs, and evading
            authorities.
        </p>
        <p>
            Development was headed by director Masayoshi Kikuchi, with art by Ryuta Ueda. The team drew influence from
            late 1990s Japanese popular culture such as the rhythm game PaRappa the Rapper and the anti-establishment
            themes in the film Fight Club. The environments were based on Tokyo shopping districts in Shibuya and
            Shinjuku, with graffiti designed by artists including Eric Haze. Jet Set Radio was the first game to use a
            cel-shaded art style, developed in response to the team's disappointment with the abundance of sci-fi and
            fantasy Sega games.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jet Set Radio received acclaim and is considered one of the best video games of all time for its graphics,
            soundtrack and gameplay. It won several awards and was nominated for many others. A Game Boy Advance
            version, developed by Vicarious Visions, was released in 2003, along with versions for Japanese mobile
            phones. In 2012, Jet Set Radio was rereleased for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, iOS, Windows, PlayStation
            Vita and Android. A sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, was released for the Xbox in 2002.

        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>
            The player controls a member of a gang of graffiti-tagging inline skaters. The game consists of three types
            of levels: Street, Rival Showdown, and Trial. The Street levels come in two categories. The first is to tag
            every graffiti point in each area previously tagged by a rival gang before the timer runs out while evading
            the authorities. The second category serves as a boss battle by chasing the rival gang members and spraying
            graffiti on them. The more graffiti points are sprayed, the more deadly the authorities become. Graffiti
            points are marked by arrows and require paint to tag them. Players can spray graffiti by either pressing a
            single button or inputting commands using the analog stick depending on the size of the graffiti spot.
            Players are unable to spray graffiti if they run out of paint, which must be refilled by obtaining yellow
            and blue spray cans scattered across the stage. Yellow spray cans refill a single spray can, and blue spray
            cans refill five. Enemies will pursue players and attempt to deplete their health. Health can be replenished
            by obtaining red and green spray cans. Performing tricks adds bonus points to the player's overall score and
            can help the player gain access to areas difficult to reach.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Rival Showdown levels, more playable characters can be unlocked after they are defeated by matching the
            rival's movements in technique sections or by spraying graffiti before the rival in race sections. Trial
            levels are unlocked after Street and Rival Showdown levels are cleared in a specific area. There are three
            kinds of trials: Jet Graffiti, Jet Tech, and Jet Crash. In Jet Graffiti, the objective is to spray all the
            graffiti points within the time limit. Jet Tech prioritizes in obtaining the top score within the time
            limit. In Jet Crash, the objective is to reach the goal and spray graffiti on it before the opponent.
            Players can customize their graffiti by choosing presets, or create their own using the Graffiti editor. By
            using a VMU, players can upload their graffiti to the official website for other players to use or download
            graffiti from other players. More Graffiti presets can be unlocked by collecting Graffiti Soul icons
            scattered throughout stages.

        <h2>Soundtrack</h2>
        <p>
            The soundtrack for Jet Set Radio contains a diverse lineup of musical talent and genres, mainly ranging from
            electronic, hip-hop, and rock, with influences from other genres like funk, coming into play. The game's
            main composer is Hideki Naganuma, who would make several original songs for the game and also pick some of
            the licensed music as well. Additional artists include fellow Sega in-house composers, Richard Jacques and
            Toronto. The original Japanese release only had licensed music from Japanese artists, Guitar Vader, Deavid
            Soul, and Idol Taxi, all three would be present in every other release of the game along with external
            artists who made original songs for the game such as the Reps, F-Fields, Castle Logical with Yoshika Sekine,
            and B.B. Rights.
        </p>
        <p>
            To appeal to international audiences, Sega would request additional levels inspired by New York City, and as
            such more artists were added to the game. A total of eight would be added but neither NTSC or PAL regions
            would receive all eight. The artists NTSC audiences would get would be Rob Zombie, being remixed by Charlie
            Clouser, Cold, and Professional Murder Music, while PAL audiences got music by Featurecast, O.B. One, and
            Semi Detached. Both regions would get songs by the Jurassic 5 and Mix Master Mike, with Japan later on
            getting the PAL region artists along with the two aforementioned ones in De La Jet Set Radio.
        </p>
        <p>
            The HD release of the game attempted to give everyone all the musical talent that contributed, but failed to
            get O.B. One back for the game, making them the only omitted artist.
        </p>
        <p>
            Jet Set Radio would have its soundtrack be released in Japan in December 20, 2000. Customers in the United
            States who pre-ordered the game would receive a music sampler, containing four additional songs not present
            in
            any release. A second soundtrack release would happen in 2012, released by Sumthing Else Works to promote
            the HD
            release of the game, as it only featured the Sega in-house songs along with Naganuma's seven original songs
            from
            Jet Set Radio Future. There would also be another soundtrack release for the HD release of the game, once
            again
            only featuring the in-house songs from Sega along with the graffiti spray sound effects.

            Jet Set Radio is recognized as one of the first games to feature cel-shaded graphics, with exaggerated
            shapes, thick lines, and flat, bright colors. Insomniac owner Ted Price credited it as an influence on their
            game Sunset Overdrive. Numerous indie developers have cited Jet Set Radio as a major influence on their
            games, the most notable being the successfully crowdfunded Hover: Revolt of Gamers, Lethal League, and Bomb
            Rush Cyberfunk, all of which draw heavy inspiration from Jet Set Radio's visuals and music and feature
            contributions from its composer, Hideki Naganuma. The game has also been speedrun at Games Done Quick
            multiple times. Other fan community-based Jet Set Radio projects include Jet Set Radio Live, a 24/7
            browser-based radio station based on the fictional radio station in-game created in January 2016 and the
            albums Memories of Tokyo-To released on February 20, 2018 and Sounds of Tokyo-To Future by American musician
            2 Mello on August 24, 2021.

            A sequel, Jet Set Radio Future, was released for the Xbox in 2002, early in the system's life cycle. Two
            main characters, Beat and Gum, are playable characters in Sega Superstars Tennis and Sonic & All-Stars
            Racing Transformed, and the former appears in Sonic Universe issue #45, an adaptation of the game along with
            Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2009, an early antagonist in the game, Captain Onishima, was ranked 95th in IGN's "Top 100 Videogame
            Villains" list. Jet Set Radio and Jet Set Radio Future are highly requested games to be ported to the Xbox
            One, the Xbox Series X/S, and the Nintendo Switch. In 2021, Sega teased the possibility of a Jet Set Radio
            reboot, and announced Beat as a playable character for Super Monkey Ball Banana Mania.
