                    Symphonic bliss awaits you as your Colorado Symphony and guest
                    conductor Aram Demirjian present a powerhouse program highlighted by
                    Vivaldi’s programmatic masterpiece, The Four Seasons. As striking
                    and admired as ever, this work conjures imagery that deftly captures
                    the essence of spring, summer, autumn, and winter through music that
                    manages to remain strikingly modern three centuries after its debut.
                    Paul Huang is just the virtuoso to embrace this beloved concerto in
                    its return to Boettcher Concert Hall.

                    The grand finale — Tchaikovsky’s Fourth Symphony — is a meticulously
                    structured meditation on fate that endures as one of his most
                    popular and identifiable compositions. Over four movements,
                    Tchaikovsky transforms his personal battle with fate into one of
                    humanity’s most powerful works of art. Among today’s best and
                    brightest composers, Jessie Montgomery’s Strum draws on the spirit
                    of dance, movement, and American folk expressions in an ecstatic
                    celebration that will have you on the edge of your seat.

                    History is replete with turning points and with the completion of
                    his revolutionary Third Symphony, Beethoven forever changed the idea
                    of what a symphony could be. A clear bridging of the Classical and
                    Romantic eras, the Eroica (“Heroic”) Symphony explores what it means
                    to be human in a work that is larger and more emotional than a
                    symphony had ever been before. In it, Beethoven’s passion rises to
                    the forefront, using broad strokes of sound to convey the very
                    nature of humanity, while reimagining a future for music filled with
                    endless possibility. Cellist Sterling Elliott — a 2021 Avery Fisher
                    Career Grant recipient — brings youthful energy to Elgar’s Cello
                    Concerto, a deeply emotional work filled with soaring themes and
                    quiet anguish that will leave audiences entranced. The Colorado
                    Symphony Chorus takes center stage on Vaughan Williams’ Walt
                    Whitman-inspired Toward the Unknown Region, a remarkable marriage of
                    music and text, with Williams’ inspired music perfectly
                    encapsulating Whitman’s noble, humanistic aspirations. These works
                    will spring to life in the hands of Maestro Peter Oundjian and your
                    Colorado Symphony.

                    Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky — so highly regarded for his symphonic
                    compositions — placed himself among the greats of the keyboard with
                    the completion of his First Piano Concerto. The work is filled with
                    towering grandeur, gorgeously lyrical melodies, and unmistakable
                    Romantic spirit. For pianists what Everest is to climbers, the
                    Concerto in B-flat has become the standard against which all
                    virtuosos must measure themselves, featuring iconic opening
                    flourishes and a pyrotechnics-filled finale. Denver favorite Olga
                    Kern lends her dazzling technique and innate musicality to this
                    cornerstone of the Classical Canon. Your Colorado Symphony and
                    Conductor Christian Reif — dubbed a “remarkable talent” by the San
                    Francisco Chronicle — conclude the program with Shostakovich’s
                    stormy and brooding Tenth Symphony. Written to symbolize the power
                    of the people, Shostakovich employs memorable themes and complex
                    orchestrations that mirror his own battles against Soviet
                    oppression. Ending on a triumphant note, this is a finale that will
                    leave you breathless.

                    Be still my heart! A whirling celebration of pagan love awaits
                    listeners with Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, which he called a
                    “symphonie chorégraphique” rather than a ballet, reflecting a sense
                    of powerful, dramatic music which defies category and springs to
                    life on terms all its own. Ravel’s exceptional score creates a
                    sensuous atmosphere with a lingering explosiveness residing just
                    underneath the surface. Scored for a massive orchestra and utilizing
                    the ethereal, intangible tones of a wordless chorus, Ravel often
                    spotlights solo players in a way that recalls chamber music rather
                    than merely using it as a show of force, pulling listeners into a
                    vast, visceral dreamscape of shimmering colors and hypnotic motion.
                    Szymanowski’s First Violin Concerto will shine in the hands of
                    Concertmaster Yumi Hwang-Williams, who brings expressive virtuosity
                    to one of the first violin concertos of the modern era. The program
                    opens with Lili Boulanger’s D’un matin de printemps, meaning ‘On a
                    spring morning,’ capturing the genius of this prodigious composer
                    who wrote over 50 compositions before tragically passing at the age
                    of just 24. This sweet and playful ode to spring is just the
                    transportive overture to carry away your winter doldrums.

                    Beethoven’s Eighth — which he referred to as “my little Symphony in
                    F,”— is the most cheery, joyful, and experimental of his symphonies.
                    Its relatively compact scale allowed Beethoven to be more
                    imaginative and structurally radical than he could dare to be on the
                    larger canvases of his other symphonies. Light-hearted and full of
                    charm, the Eighth is an often-overlooked gem that will shine under
                    the baton of Resident Conductor Christopher Dragon. Celebrate the
                    Colorado Symphony Horns as they take center stage on Schumann’s
                    Konzertstück for 4 Horns and Orchestra, incorporating the warmth,
                    nobility, and hunting-horn origins of German Romantic-era music
                    while conjuring images of the unspoiled forests of the German
                    landscape. In an ironic twist, the performance begins with a
                    “Farewell”, harkening back to the piece’s debut when Haydn
                    instructed his musicians to stop playing one by one during the final
                    movement, snuff out the candle on their music stand, and walk off
                    the stage in turn, leaving just two violins to convey the final
                    notes. In this uniquely imaginative performance, seeing is
                    believing.

                    One of the most accomplished of all piano works, Beethoven’s
                    “Emperor” Concerto features a striking opening movement and a
                    glorious finale, with beauty and virtuosic style throughout that
                    makes it one of the composer’s best. Your Colorado Symphony welcomes
                    electrifying pianist Stewart Goodyear who is just the firebrand to
                    live up to the wiles of this majestic and vigorously demanding
                    concerto. Teddy Abrams — Musical America’s 2022 Conductor of the
                    Year — brings dynamic flair to Perkinson’s energetic Worship
                    Overture. Prokofiev’s Fifth Symphony was so well received that
                    within months of its American premiere, a portrait of the composer
                    was featured on the cover of Time magazine. Prokofiev wrote that he
                    “conceived of it as glorifying the grandeur of the human spirit,
                    praising the free and happy man— his strength, his generosity, and
                    the purity of his soul." This heroic and joyous work offers a
                    brilliant conclusion to a performance of energizing masterworks.

                    One of the foremost conductors of his generation, Alexander Shelley
                    joins your Colorado Symphony for a program that will leave you
                    simply spellbound. Spanish composer Joaquín Rodrigo’s classical
                    guitar concerto Concierto de Aranjuez fills the concert hall with
                    the immortal sounds and traditions of Spanish romanticism in a
                    must-hear interpretation from guitar virtuoso Pablo Sainz Villegas
                    who was hailed as “The global ambassador of Spanish guitar” by
                    Billboard Magazine. Anna Clyne’s This Midnight Hour is mysterious
                    and foreboding, with musical twists and turns that show why she is
                    considered one of the preeminent composers of our time. Bartók’s
                    Concerto for Orchestra was called a concerto rather than a symphony
                    as each section of instruments is treated in a soloistic and
                    virtuosic way, combining elements of Western art music and Hungarian
                    folk songs in a stirring finale to an evening of symphonic
                    sublimity.

                    Unlike other Requiem Masses, Brahms’ A German Requiem is not
                    primarily a Mass for the dead. Instead, it is intended as comfort
                    and solace for those left behind as they mourn the death of others.
                    Confronting life as much as it does death, Brahms further
                    differentiates his Requiem by setting excerpts from the Lutheran
                    Bible and apocrypha in German instead of the Catholic, Latin text
                    used in the Requiem Masses by Mozart, Verdi, and Berlioz. The
                    Colorado Symphony Chorus and two vocal soloists lend distinction to
                    this stunning masterpiece, which remains one of the most revered
                    choral works ever composed. A taste for the exotic surfaces often in
                    the catalogue of Maurice Ravel and his orchestral song cycle
                    Shéhérazade is no exception. Named for the protagonist of One
                    Thousand and One Nights, Shéhérazade is a woman who employs her
                    imagination as a means of escape. "Je voudrais voir...", she
                    repeats, meaning "I would like to see...", this refrain sets the
                    tone for Ravel’s song cycle which drips with color evoking images of
                    the far east. Drawing on music from the opera, Weber’s Overture to
                    Oberon is a celebration of the supernatural realm. Like in Mozart's
                    The Magic Flute, Weber establishes Oberon's horn as a mystical
                    instrument and its call as a leitmotif throughout the overture,
                    unleashing an exuberant conversation between instrumental voices and
                    concluding with a virtuosic flourish conducted by Maestro Peter
                    Oundjian.

                    Join your Colorado Symphony and Principal Conductor Peter Oundjian
                    in welcoming acclaimed soloist and 2021 Gramophone Artist of the
                    Year, James Ehnes, to Boettcher Concert Hall for a reinvigoration of
                    Beethoven’s majestic Violin Concerto. Beethoven’s output in nearly
                    every musical genre was prolific, yet surprisingly he wrote only one
                    concerto for the violin. The four opening drum taps that begin this
                    masterpiece remain one of the most surprising and audacious ideas
                    that the composer ever committed to paper, setting the stage for a
                    transcendent work that stands among the greats of the repertoire.
                    Bruckner’s Seventh Symphony emphatically elevated him into the ranks
                    of legendary 19th century composers in a work that is epic in scope
                    and scale, with knowing nods to Beethoven’s Third Symphony and
                    Wagner’s Ring Cycle, including his use of the famous Wagner tubas.
                    This revered work caps an awe-inspiring program of inspiring
                    masterworks led by Maestro Oundjian.
